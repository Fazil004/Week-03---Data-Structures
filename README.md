## **Overview**

This week focused on commonly used data structures and foundational algorithms. We covered linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash maps along with search and sorting techniques. We also explored efficient input handling in Java and developed a basic understanding of algorithm complexity using Big-O notation.

## **Topics Covered**

### **Day 1: Data Structure Introduction and LinkedList**

* What are data structures?  
* Types of data structures  
* Introduction to `LinkedList` in Java  
* Operations on linked lists (insertion, deletion, traversal)  
* Differences between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`  

### **Day 2: Stack, Queue, HashMap and Hashing Function**

* Stack: LIFO structure, push/pop/peek operations  
* Queue: FIFO structure, enqueue/dequeue operations  
* Java Collections Framework implementations  
* Introduction to `HashMap`  
* Understanding hash functions and collisions  

### **Day 3: Sorting Algorithms**

* Why sorting is important  
* Bubble Sort  
* Selection Sort  
* Insertion Sort  
* Overview of efficient algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)  

### **Day 4 & 5: Linear Search, Binary Search, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, BufferedReader, FileReader, InputStreamReader**

* Linear Search vs. Binary Search  
* Java implementations of search algorithms  
* Working with large strings using `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`  
* File and input handling with `BufferedReader`, `FileReader`, and `InputStreamReader`  

### **Day 6: Algorithm's Runtime Analysis & Big-O Notation**

* Understanding algorithm efficiency  
* Time complexity and space complexity  
* Big-O notation and its common classes (O(1), O(n), O(nÂ²), etc.)  
* Analyzing the performance of sorting and searching algorithms  

## **Prerequisites**

* Completion of Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming  
* Familiarity with Java syntax, classes, and methods  
* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed  
* A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code  

## **How to Use This Repository**

This repository is structured to reflect the topics covered each day. You can find code examples, notes, or exercises within the respective daily folders (if available). Feel free to explore the code, run it, and modify it to deepen your understanding.

## **Next Steps**

In Week 4, we will focus on exception handling, multithreading, and advanced file operations. Keep practicing and stay consistent!
